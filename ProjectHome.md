[UCAIR (User-Centered Adaptive Information Retrieval)](http://sifaka.cs.uiuc.edu/ir/ucair/) is a client-side agent for personalized information retrieval.

This Google Code site is the code repository for UCAIR's current version (as of June 2010), which is implemented as a client-side HTTP proxy. You can go to the downloads page for the latest software and check the wiki for usage. For background information regarding the UCAIR project, please refer to the [main UCAIR site](http://sifaka.cs.uiuc.edu/ir/ucair/).

**Update 2013-05-08:**

**I have a new Java-based implementation that's completely re-architected. Please see [here](http://code.google.com/p/ucair/wiki/NewUCAIRJavaImplementation) for details.**
